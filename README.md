# Planemo

Planemo is a collection of 21 unique illustrations of dark, rogue parts of the universe. We've built the collection around a concept of Planemo — a large planet that does not orbit a star, but rather wander cold and alone through the cosmos. It is believed that most planemos once orbited their mother star but were ejected from the star system by gravitational interaction with another massive object. Claim your Planemo and fill the void. Make its lone dark part of the universe your own.

Your Planemo grants you access to pre-sale in our future mints and will also allow you to directly contribute to our generative art. Visit HxScollective.art for more details about the collection or our other projects.
